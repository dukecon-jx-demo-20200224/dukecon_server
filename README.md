## DB
* H2 in development mode
  * In-Memory (`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`)
  * DB console: `http://localhost:8080/develop/h2-console/`
* PostgreSQL with profile _"postgresql"_
  * activate with `-Dspring.profiles.active=postgresql`
  * to run the tests against the PostgreSQL db (and a previously reset of the db), you need the _"postgresql-test"_ profile (`-Dspring.profiles.active=postgresql-test`)

## Dependency Management
* Maven build fails in verify phase if declared dependencies are unused or used dependencies are undeclared
  * mvn verify
  * CI calls mvn deploy which includes verify
  * the acutal goal is mvn dependency:analyze(-only) which may show warnings
* dependency analyzing may cause problems because of Spring Boot starter dependencies
  * configure <ignoredUnusedDeclaredDependencies> in pom.xml
